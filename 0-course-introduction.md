- **Most exams are open and hard**
  - **Exams except the final are open**. You can use the Internet, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, your notes, your friends, your pets...
  - **Online exams are hard**. They test your implicit learning, not what you can look up. Read: [What is the purpose of an impossible RoE exam?](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838/2)
- **Self Assessment helps you drop this course**. You'll start with a mandatory self-assessment. Your score isn't be counted, but please drop this course if you score low. It'll be too tough for you. You have been warned ðŸ™‚!
- **Graded Assignments check basic learning**. The graded assignment after each module has ~10 multiple-choice questions. You have a week to submit.

### Projects assess application and are peer reviewed

TDS has 2 projects that test how well you _apply_ what you learnt.

These will be peer-evaluated, to teach you how to evaluate others' work and to learn from it.

- Each project is scored by 3 peers on well-defined criteria, for a total of 100.
- 20% of your score will be the average of the 3 peer evaluations (dropping outliers).

A peer evaluation is ignored as an outlier if:

- The score is over Â±30 vs the average of the other 2 reviewers' scores.
- A reviewer gives everyone the same score.

Peer reviewers without outliers get 1 bonus mark (out of 100).

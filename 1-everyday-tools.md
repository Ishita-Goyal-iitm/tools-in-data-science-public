Some tools are fundamental to data science because they are industry standards and widely used by data science professionals. Mastering these tools will align you with current best practices and making you more adaptable in a fast-evolving industry.

The tools we cover here are not just popular — they're powerful enablers of effective work. They represent the core technology behind most of today's data science and software development. Adopting these gives you a professional mindset and workflow that will serve you throughout your career.

## Editor: VS Code, Google Colab

Your editor is the most important tool in your arsenal. That's where you'll spend most of your time. Make sure you're comfortable with it.

[**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is, _by far_, the most popular code editor today. According to the [2024 StackOverflow Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology/#1-integrated-development-environment) almost 75% of developers use it. We recommend you learn it well. Even if you use another editor, you'll be working with others who use it, and it's a good idea to have some exposure.

[![Google Colab features you may have missed (5 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/rNgswRZ2C1Y/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/rNgswRZ2C1Y)

### Modern alternatives

- AI Editors: [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/cody), and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) use LLMs to help you write code faster.
  We believe this will be a standard tool in every developer's toolkit.
- [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) is an emerging alternative to Jupyter Notebooks that is reactive (i.e. you can edit code and see the results immediately).

## Browser: DevTools

[Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/) is the de facto standard for web development. It's a free tool that's built into every Chrome (and many other) browsers. You'll use this a lot when debugging and inspecting web pages.

Watch videos from the playlist below to get started with DevTools.

[![DevTools Tips playlist](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/t1c5tNPpXjs/sddefault.webp)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIAcezfL8q0rjt13ufKseL5X)

## Terminal: Bash

Most tools we use are command line tools, so it's important to be comfortable with the terminal.

UNIX shells are the de facto standard in the data science world and [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is the most popular. This is available by default on Mac and Linux. On Windows, install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to get a UNIX shell.

Watch this video to understand the basics of Bash and UNIX shell commands (75 min).

[![Beginner's Guide to the Bash Terminal (75 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/oxuRxtrO2Ag/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/oxuRxtrO2Ag)

## Spreadsheet: Excel, Google Sheets

You'll use spreadsheets for data cleaning and exploration. The most popular spreadsheet program is [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) followed by [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).

You may be already familiar with these. If not, make sure to learn the basics of both.

Go through the [**Microsoft Excel** video training](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-video-training-9bc05390-e94c-46af-a5b3-d7c22f6990bb) and make sure you cover:

## Database: SQLite

Relational databases are used to store data in a structured way. You'll often access databases created by others for analysis.

PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle, etc. are popular databases. But the most installed database is [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). It's embedded into many devices and apps (e.g. your phone, browser, etc.). It's lightweight but very scalable and powerful.

Watch these introductory videos to understand SQLite and how it's used in Python (34 min):

[![SQLite Introduction - Beginners Guide to SQL and Databases (22 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8Xyn8R9eKB8/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8Xyn8R9eKB8)

[![SQLite Backend for Beginners - Create Quick Databases with Python and SQL (13 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Ohj-CqALrwk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/Ohj-CqALrwk)

There are many non-relational databases (NoSQL) like [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/), [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/), etc. that you should know about and we may cover later.

Here are a few GUI tools that may help you:

- [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) is a GUI for SQLite.
- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) is a GUI for many databases.

## Version Control: Git, GitHub

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the de facto standard for version control of software (and sometimes, data as well). It's a system that keeps track of changes you make to files and folders. It allows you to revert to a previous state, compare changes, etc. It's a central tool in any developer's workflow.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is the most popular hosting service for Git repositories. It's a website that shows your code, allows you to collaborate with others, and provides many useful tools for developers.

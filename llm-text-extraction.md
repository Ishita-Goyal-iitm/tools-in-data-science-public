You'll learn how to use LLMs to extract structure from unstructured data, covering:

- **LLM for Data Extraction**: Use OpenAI's API to extract structured information from unstructured data like addresses.
- **JSON Schema**: Define a JSON schema to ensure consistent and structured output from the LLM.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Craft effective prompts to guide the LLM's response and improve accuracy.
- **Data Cleaning**: Use string functions and OpenAI's API to clean and standardize data.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze extracted data using Pandas to gain insights.
- **LLM Limitations**: Understand the limitations of LLMs, including potential errors and inconsistencies in output.
- **Production Use Cases**: Explore real-world applications of LLMs for data extraction, such as customer service email analysis.

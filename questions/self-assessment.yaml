    What does this code print:

    ```python
    def func(a, b=5, c=10):
        return a + b * 2 + c * 3

    func(3, c=7)
    ```
  choices:
    - text: 52
      score: 0.0
      reason: Students might mistakenly calculate the expression as 3 + 5 * 2 + 7 * 3 instead of using the default value for b.
    - text: 34
      score: 1.0
      reason: Correct
    - text: 70
      score: 0.0
      reason: This could happen if a student misunderstands the order of operations, calculating it as (3 + 5) * 2 + (7 + 10) * 3.
    - text: 28
      score: 0.0
      reason: Resulting from the 0.0 application of the function parameters, like interpreting c=7 as an additional parameter to be added, calculating 3 + 5 * 2 + 10 * 3 + 7.
